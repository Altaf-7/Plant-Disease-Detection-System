# Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture

## Problem Statement
Agriculture faces significant challenges due to plant diseases, leading to reduced crop yield and economic losses. Early detection and effective management of plant diseases are crucial for sustainable farming. This project addresses the need for a deep learning-based solution to identify and classify plant diseases from leaf images. 

## Project Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:
1. To design and implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that:
   - Accurately classifies healthy and diseased leaves.
   - Predicts the specific disease type for various crops, including apple, cherry, grape, and corn.
2. To enable precision agriculture by providing early disease diagnosis and promoting effective crop management.
3. To create a user-friendly tool accessible to farmers and agricultural professionals for informed decision-making.

## Tools and Frameworks
1. **Python**: For data processing, model building, and performance evaluation.
2. **Jupyer Notebook**: For efficient model development using cloud-based GPUs/TPUs.
3. **TensorFlow/Keras**: For implementing CNN architectures.
4. **Streamlit**: For developing an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## About the Dataset
- **Description**: The dataset comprises approximately 87,000 RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves, categorized into 38 different classes. It includes training (80%), validation (20%), and a separate set of test images.
- **Source**: [Kaggle - New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset/data?select=New+Plant+Diseases+Dataset%28Augmented%29).

## Expected Outcomes
1. A CNN model capable of accurately identifying plant diseases with robust performance.
2. A streamlined interface for disease prediction to aid farmers in real-world scenarios.
3. Insights into the challenges and opportunities in plant disease detection using deep learning.
